=====================

Author

N.S.Lin @ CSIE.NTNU @ Taiwan

Compiler
--------
Linux:
GCC 4.6 or later versions.
with option -std=c++0x (-std=c++11 is also okey if later than GCC 4.7)

Windows(not suggested):
MinGW 4.6 or later versions.
with option -std=c++0x (-std=c++11 is also okey if later than GCC 4.7)

MinGW 4.6 do not support c++11 random, so cstdlib rand() instead.


Project Setting
---------------
Windows:
 Code::Blocks will miss the project setting (bug?)
 in Code::Blocks click Project->Build options->Search dir..
 add the folder where "mini_monopoly.cbp" is
 (Eg. "C:\monopoly\mini_monopoly.cbp" => add "C:\monopoly\")
